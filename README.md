# beatport-renamer

This project is outdated and not maintained anymore. If you search a tool to manage your Dj library (especially purchased on Beatport), you can try [Tag Your Music](http://www.tagyourmusic.org/) instead. First releases are [available for download](http://www.tagyourmusic.org/download.html) and [the project](https://github.com/alorence/tym) is also hosted on GitHub.
